RUNNING

To run, will need tools as well, after cloning do:
    git submodule init ; git submodule update


NOTES

--

FYI, Rebased to cleanup commit names, split multi-bot commits, and remove the
superfluous tools/ etc. I moved some script submits around too, so likely
broken at points in history.
