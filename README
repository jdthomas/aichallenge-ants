This was my submission to the aichallenge.org 2011 competition: ANTS!

RUNNING

To run, will need tools as well, after cloning do:
    git submodule init ; git submodule update


NOTES

The final changes I chose not to submit as I was unable to do much testing with
the even diffusion fix. Just hoping the final tournament doesn't have a lot of
non-square maps.

The tournament stuff I whipped up one weekend, was going to use it in a GA
fashion to learn better weights. Found, though, that I didn't have enough CPU
power to run many 4 player games at once and thus wasn't able to get much
useful information. Also, later I broke that code, so don't try it :)

FYI, Rebased to cleanup commit names, split multi-bot commits, and remove the
superfluous tools/ etc. I moved some script submits around too, so likely
broken at points in history.
